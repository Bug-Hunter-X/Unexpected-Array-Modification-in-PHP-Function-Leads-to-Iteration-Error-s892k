# PHP Unexpected Array Modification Leading to Iteration Error

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in PHP that can occur when a function modifies an array in an unexpected way.  The core issue lies in assumptions made during array iteration after a function call.  The `foreach` loop makes an assumption about the array's structure which can break if the function changes it unexpectedly. 

The provided files contain examples of the error and its solution.
